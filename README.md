<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

Build the page with a mobile-first approach, always thinking about responsiveness and using semantic HTML
Used flexbox and position absolute to place the card which was quite easy
Tried to add some javascript to give functionality on the hamburger menu, but since I don't have much experience with JS yet, I encounter some bugs that need to be resolved:
when we click on the hamburger icon when it's active instead of the nav links, the noscroll function stays on and we can't scroll the webpage;
the function noscroll doesn't work correctly on safari.
